# []{#pre-why}vi. Rationale for Packages in the Book {#vi.-rationale-for-packages-in-the-book .sect1}

:::: {.sect1 lang="en"}
The goal of LFS is to build a complete and usable foundation-level system---including all the packages needed to replicate itself---and providing a relatively minimal base from which to customize a more complete system based on the user\'s choices. This does not mean that LFS is the smallest system possible. Several important packages are included that are not, strictly speaking, required. The list below documents the reasons each package in the book has been included.

::: itemizedlist
-   Acl

    This package contains utilities to administer Access Control Lists, which are used to define fine-grained discretionary access rights for files and directories.

-   Attr

    This package contains programs for managing extended attributes on file system objects.

    This package contains programs for generating Make files from a template. It is often needed to rebuild a package after the build procedure has been updated.

-   Bash

    This package satisfies an LSB core requirement to provide a Bourne Shell interface to the system. It was chosen over other shell packages because of its common usage and extensive capabilities.

    This package implements the userspace interfaces to the POSIX 1003.1e capabilities available in Linux kernels.

-   Libelf

    The elfutils project provides libraries and tools for ELF files and DWARF data. Most utilities in this package are available in other packages, but the library is needed to build the Linux kernel using the default (and most efficient) configuration.

-   Libffi

    This package implements a portable, high level programming interface to various calling conventions. Some programs may not know at the time of compilation what arguments are to be passed to a function. For instance, an interpreter may be told at run-time about the number and types of arguments used to call a given function. Libffi can be used in such programs to provide a bridge from the interpreter program to compiled code.

-   Libpipeline

    The Libpipeline package supplies a library for manipulating pipelines of subprocesses in a flexible and convenient way. It is required by the Man-DB package.

-   Man-pages

    This package provides the actual contents of the basic Linux man pages.

-   Meson

-   MPC

    This package supplies arithmetic functions for complex numbers. It is required by GCC.

-   MPFR

    This package contains functions for multiple precision arithmetic. It is required by GCC.

-   Ninja

    This package furnishes a small build system with a focus on speed. It is designed to have its input files generated by a higher-level build system, and to run builds as fast as possible. This package is required by Meson.

    This package is an interpreter for the runtime language PERL. It is needed for the installation and test suites of several LFS packages.

-   Pkgconf

    This package contains a program which helps to configure compiler and linker flags for development libraries. The program can be used as a drop-in replacement of [**pkg-config**]{.command}, which is needed by the building system of many packages. It\'s maintained more actively and slightly faster than the original Pkg-config package.

-   Procps-NG

    This package contains programs for monitoring processes. These programs are useful for system administration, and are also used by the LFS Bootscripts.

-   Psmisc

    This package produces programs for displaying information about running processes. These programs are useful for system administration.

-   Wheel

    This package supplies a Python module that is the reference implementation of the Python wheel packaging standard.

-   XML::Parser

    This package is a Perl module that interfaces with Expat.
